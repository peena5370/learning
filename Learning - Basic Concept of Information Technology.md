- 21st century has brought the information era, the rapid pace computerised systems being used in almost all types of areas, from medical and space exploration to education, as well as banking and manufacturing sectors
- Evolution of Agricultural, Industrial and Information Era

|  Evolution  |  Agricultural Era  |  Industrial Era  |  Information Era  |
|  :-------:  |  :--------------:  |  :------------:  |  :-------------:  |
|  Mostly  |  Pleasants/farmers  |  Factory workers  |  Knowledge workers  |

    4. It Provides Basis for Optimisation
    5. Success in IT Depends on the Effectiveness in Using It
    6. IT is Embedded or Integrated into Many Products and Services
- _Definitions of Information Technology:_ It defines as a broad-based technology required to support information systems, activities that involves in creation, storage, manipulation and communication of information, together with their related methods, management and applications.
- 5 components of Information Technology:
    1. _Data_: A collection of raw facts and figures that are used by programs to produce useful information. This data can be organised in databases or file systems.
    2. _Prodecures_: These are policies that define how and by whom the IT is used, actions that are used by people when processing data into information, operating prodecures to operate the computer, data entry, communication, maintenance, back-up, recovery and troubleshooting.
    3. _Software_: Computer programs such as application software(word processor, spreadsheet, graphical package, databases, etc.) and system software(OS, communication software, etc.).
    4. _People_: Information systems are program by people and people are also the users of IT availabel. The success or failure of an IT system depends on people too.
    5. _Hardware_: This consists of the computer and its components; input hardware(keyboard, mouse, etc.), processing hardware(processor, memory, etc.), output hardware(monitor, printer, etc.), storage hardware(disk drive, etc.) and communication devices(modem, etc.).
- Principles of Information Technology

|  Principle  |  Description  |
|  :--------  |  :----------  |
|  Reliable  |  It is imposibble to say that an IT system works 100% all the time.</br>Sometimes, it works 99% of the time and 1% it does not work.</br>However, it is important that reliability does not go below a certain threshold.  |
|  Secure  |  The environment in which the IT system operates must be secure from unauthorised access or malicious destruction.  |
|  Flexible  |  People are able to use the IT system anywhere they are and anytime.  |
|  Foster innovation  |  Creativity in developing new software and hardware for the new era, such as early warning systems for bad weather.  |
|  Responsive  |  IT system is able to provide a range of services.  |
|  Easy and transparent  |  All the tools and facilities should be easy to learn and use.  |
|  Consistent interoperability  |  The IT environment must be consistent, internationally accepted so that information acan be exchanged readily.  |
|  Affordable  | People should be able to afford the IT systems they intend to use.  |

|  Benefit  |  Elaboration  |
|  :------  |  :----------  |
|  Knowing superiority of the programming languages and where it is suitable to be used  |  For example, if development involves a rapid prototype, then , it is more efficient to use scripting language like Python, rather than using C or C++  |
|  Understanding weaknesses of the programming languages  |  Each language is suitable for one field. For example, to develop graphical user interface(GUI), it is more efficient to use C++ or Java rather than C. To do a lot of calculations, Fortran is more suitable than Java or C.  |
|  Producing more efficient solutions  |  If a user understands a few programming languages, he/she can use the most efficient language for solving problem. For example, if the solution requires access to databases, it is better to use scripting language like Python for linking rather than C or C++.  |
|  Programming languages will influence users' thinking in solving problems  |  For example, an object-oriented language will make user think of a solution based on the object concept, while a logic-based language will make the user think of the solution, based on logic.  |
|  Programming languages are tools for solving problems by using the computer  |  Most problems are more efficiently solved by experts in the respective fields. Therefore, experts in certain fields can learn appropriate programming languages in order to solve their problems.  |

|  Societal solutions  |  IT can address the needs of people on the street and provide solutions to several problems in our society. Societal networking software like e-mail, Facebook and chatting help people to communicate and interact easily and quickly making distance quite a trivial matter. The world also has been transformed into a virtual global village and without borders.  |
|  Employment  |  The impact on workers who feel financially threatened, such as in factories where the management reduces staff size because of some processes being replaced by robots. Similarly, in the banking field when they use automated teller machine(ATM) and online banking, which make the traditional cashiers redundant.  |
|  Working conditions  |  When the used of IT improves, so does the quality of work and environment. What used to be physical has now become largely mental work.  |
|  Health  |  Where the use of IT hardware can endanger its users, such as spoiling eyesight, exposure to radiation and strain on the back.  |
| Privacy  |   Where personal information, computerised comparison, information mining and e-mails are exposed to personal trespassing.  |
|  Individuality  |  In system development, one must think of human factor, ergonomic factor and the possibility of information system failure.  |
