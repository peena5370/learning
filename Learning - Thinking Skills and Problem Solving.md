# THINKING SKILLS AND PROBLEM SOLVING

### Topic 1 -Thinking Skills
- Thinking is defined as a purposeful mental activity aover which we have some power or control.
- The most important mental activities included in the thinking process are:
  1. careful observation
  2. remembering
  3. wondering
  4. inquiring
  5. imagining
  6. evaluating
  7. judging
  8. intepreting
- Importance of thinking
- Phases of thinking process
  1. Production Phase
  2. Judgement Phase


### Topic 2 - Critical and Creative Thinking
- 2 basic of thinking skills:
  1. _Critical thinking_
    - think logically by following an argument, compare, classify and sequence, and how to use deductive and inductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion
    - characteristics of critical thinking:
      1. clarity
      2. precision
      3. accurary
      4. relevance
      5. consistency
      6. logical correctness
      7. completeness
      8. fairness
    - barriers to critical thinking:
      - lack of relevant background information, poor reading skills, bias, prejudice, superstition, self-centred thinking, etc.
  2. _Creative thinking_
    - think creatively such as sxploring ideas, generating new possibilities, looking for flexibility in answers and developing leads worthy of eleboration
    - characteristices of creative thinking
      1. dynamism
      2. daringness
      3. resourcefulness
      4. deligence
      5. independence
    - methods to apply creativity to problems and issues:
      1. taking an innovative and new approach
      2. devising or changing a process or system
      3. coming up with a new product or service
      4. searching for new uses for existing things
      5. improvising on existing things
      6. discovering or redefining a concept
  3. _Lateral thinking_
    - lateral thinking has the ability of transforming problems into opportunity, search for alternative solutions and significantly increase the number of original and practical ideas employing unusual thinking tehcniques that are normally not within the ability of our normal methods of thinking.
    - usually employed by individuals who are given the responsibility of comming up with new strategies in the R & D sector.


### Topic 3 - Identifying Reasons and Conclusions
- Language of reasoning
  - Words or phrases that used to show that the claim indicated is a conclusion for which reasons have been presented:
    - therefore, so, hence, thus, consequently, which proves/establishes that, justifies the belief/view that, it can be concluded that, from which we can infer, it follows that/it demonstrates that, must
  - Words or phrases that are commonly utilised to signal the presence of reasons:
    - beacause, since, for, follows from the fact that, the reasons are, firstly, secondly
- Thinking Map for understanding and evaluating reasoning
  - Thinking Map - Skillful Analysis and Evaluation of Arguments

    |  Analysis  |
    |  :---------  |
    1. What is/are the main conclusion(s)?
       (May be stated or unstated; may be in the forms of recommendations, or explanations and so on. The presence of conclusion indicator words such as "therefore" may help.)
       [Aim: It helps in organising our thinking about a piece of reasoning if we know what the author is trying to persuade and/or convince us]
    2. What are the reasongs(data, evidence, etc) and their structure?
    3. What is assumed(that is, implicit or taken for granted, perhaps in the context)?
    4. Clarify the meaning(by the terms, claims or arguments) which needs it.

    </br>

    |  Evaluation  |
    |  :----------  |
    5. Are the reasons acceptable? 
        (These include explicit and unstated assumptions - these may also involve evaluating factual claims, definitions and value judgements and judging the credibility of the source.)</br>
        (a) Does the reasoning support its conclusion(s)?</br>
        (For example, is the supporting argument strong as "beyond reasonable doubt" or weak)?</br>
        (b) Are there other relevant considerations/arguments which strengthen or weaken the case?</br>
        (You may already know these or may have to construct them)</br>
        [Aim: Also called critico-creative thinking, which requires us to consider any other relevant ideas we know or can think up which will help us to arrive at a good judgement fro the case in hand].</br>
    6. What is the overall evaluation based on what we have obtained above?

    </br>

- Acceptability of reasons
  - How to evaluate the reason systematically:
    1. Are the reasons _acceptable_(true, valid, factual, etc.)?
    2. Does the reasoning _support_ its conclusion(s)?
    3. Are there _other relevant considerations/arguments_?
    4. What is your _overall evaluation on this topic_?
- Steps in evaluating the acceptability of a claim:
  1. How certain is the claim?
  2. Does the context of the claim influence its acceptability?
  3. Does the claim require expertise/research to decide?
  4. Is it widely known or believed?
  5. How well does the claim fit with out other beliefs?
  6. If it from a credible source?
- Criteria of judging the credibility of sources:
  - the source's _reputation_ for reliability
  - whether the source has a _vested interest_
  - whether there is _coorboration_ or _validation_ of the claim from independent sources
  - whether the source has the relevant _expertise or training_
  - the _nature_ of the claim itself
  - whether the source can provide _credible reasons_ for the claim they make


### Topic 4 - Problem Solving
- problem solving is a series of techniques, both cognitive and behavioural, that can be applied in various fields or areas to generate solutions
- _Stages in Problem Solving_
  1. Recognising and Defining a Problem

  |  Closed-ended Problems  |  Open-ended Problems  |
  |  :--------------------  |  :------------------  |
  |  Have one or a limited number of possible solutions.  |  Can be solved using many different methods.  |
  |  Problem analysis involves identifying all the possible causes before looking for a solution.  |  Problem analysis involves looking for information which will help to suggest a range of possible ways to solve the problem.  |

  </br>
  - analyse a problem throughly in order to fully understand it and subsequently come up with various solutions that can help in achieving the goals</br>
  - involves identify and bring together relevant information, and presenting it in a meaningful way</br>
  2. Finding Possible Solutions</br>
    - coming up with various actions to solve a problem involves finding out what appropriate actions to take, what the hindrances are and finally working towards achieving the goals.</br>
    - may be necessary to modify and combine ideas using any creative technique available in order to devise a workable solution</br>
  3. Selecting the Best Solution</br>
    - decision making process is made based on a comparison of the potential outcomes of alternative solutions</br>
    - Stage of decision making:</br>
      1. identify the solutions</br>
      2. eliminate the solutions that cannot overcome the limitations</br>
      3. evaluate the remaining solutions</br>
      4. evaluating the risks linked to the best solution</br>
      5. making decision on the chosen solution and implement it</br>
  4. Implementing the Solution</br>
    - Steps invloved in the implementation of a solution:</br>

  |  Step  |  Description  |
  |  :---:  |  :---  |
  |  Planning and preparing to implement the solution.  |  Involves the conclusion of all efforts and thorough planning that describes the sequence of actions needed to fulfill the objective, timescale and resources required at each stage.  |
  |  Taking the appropriate action and monitoring its effect.  |  Problems or potential problems have to be dealt with immediately in order to ensure that things run smoothly.  |
  |  Reviewing the success of the action.  |  This is important to estimate the efficacy of the action in solving future similar problems and to make sure that the problem has been solved.  |

### Topic 5 - Development of Problem Solving
- Development of Problem Solving
  - Aspects of the Development of problem solving

  |  Aspect  |  Significant Stage in Life  |
  |  :-----  |  :------------------------  |
  |  Formation strategies  |  Plays a vital role from infancy(birth to 12 months)  |
  |  Employment of varied representations(such as language, maps and models)  |  Shows more prominence during toodlerhood(one through three years)  |
  |  Cognitive self-regulation  |  Becomes more important during the pre-school years(three to five years) as children have more varied strategies and representations from which to select and greater cognitive resources to dedicate to planning, self-monitoring, and other regulatory processes.  |

</br>


### Topic 6 - Problem-Solving Strategies
- Conceptualisation in problem solving
  - stepwise conceptions of problem solving:
    1. finding the problem
    2. representing the problem
    3. planning the solution
    4. carrying out the plan
    5. evaluating the solution
    6. consolidating gains
- Problem solving strategies
  1. decomposition or subgoaling
    - tree pattern(parent problem, child problem, sibling problem) - for large problem
  2. working backwards(find solution from A(initial state) to B(goal))
    - flow chart(if condition, else condition)
  3. hill climbing
    - wave diagram
  4. means-end analysis(MEA)
    - commonly use in AI for limiting search in AI program
  5. forward chaining(use for experts)
    - popular in implements strategy for expert systems, business and production rule systems
    - opposite of working backwards
  6. analogy in problem solving
  7. specialisation and generalisation
  8. extreme cases


### Topic 7 - Problem-Solving Tools
- Brainstroming
  - a lively technique that helps a group to generate as many ideas as possible in a short time
  - steps of approaching brainstroming:
    1. define and agree on the objective
    2. explain the method to be employed
    3. allow time to reflect on the purpose of the session
    4. generate ideas
    5. discuss the ideas
    6. come to the best solution for the problem
- Benchmarking
  - a process of measuring and comparing an organisation's internal processes with those of another organisation that has outstanding practices in order to study ways to improce those processes
- Cause and effect diagrams(fishbone diagram)
  - a diagram that combines brainstroming with the use of a concept map
  - steps to develop fishbone diagram:
    1. identify the problem
    2. work out the major factors involved
    3. identify possible causes
    4. analyse the diagram
- Flow charts
  - a simplified form of system diagrams that show how the steps in a process relate to each other
  - consists of START and FINISH label, if else statement, conditions, flow arrow
- Swot analysis
  - Swot stands for _Strengths_, _Weaknesses_, _Opportunities_, and _Threats_.
  - a technique often used in a business context to allow an organisation to identify its niche in a market
  - sutuation analysis >>> internal analysis >>> strenth, weakness  
  - situation analysis >>> external analysis >>> opportunities, threats
- Prioritisation matrix(survey table)
  - a useful tool for reaching a consessus in a group problem solving or decision making scenario
  - Using instruction:
    1. conduct a brainstroming session and fill out a prioritisation matrix
    2. in the first column, write down the problems that were mentioned in the brainstroming session
    3. in the second to fourth columns, define the criteria(frequency, importance, feasibility)
    4. develop any criterion that is vital for the problem(may include cost, value, safety, timing and duration)
    5. do a survey and let other individual participating in the development of a solution gets to vote for each criterion


### Topic 8 - Decision Making
- Decision making
  - the act or process of deciding; determination, as a question or doubt, by making a judgemet; the act of or need for making up one's mind
- Types of decisions
  1. _decisions"whether"_ - yes/no
  2. _decisions"which"_ - involves 1 choice or more choices from selection of possibilities
  3. _"contingent" decisions_ - if...else
- Factors incluences the decision-making process
  1. selective search for evidence
  2. premature termination of search for evidence
  3. inertia(unwilling to change thought patterns)
  4. choice-supportive bias
  5. recency(tendency to trust more recent information)
  6. repetition bias(bias to believe information that hear most often)
  7. group think
  8. source credibility bias(tendency to bias towards people we know)
- 4 Quadrants of the brain and different thinking styles
  1. analytical/logical
  2. organisational
  3. emotional/interpersonal
  4. conceptual/imaginative
- Evidence-driven decision-making cycle
  1. _Trigger_(data indicate a possible issue that could impact on student achievement)
  2. _Explore_(check data and evidence to explore the issue)
  3. _Question_(Clarify the issue and ask a question)
  4. _Assemble_(decide what data and evidence might be useful)
  5. _Analyse_(data and evidence)
  6. _Interpret_(insights that answer the question)
  7. _Intervene_(plan an action aimed at improving achievement)
  8. _Act_(carry out the intervention)
  9. _Evaluate_(the impact on the intervention)
  10. _Reflect_(on what has been learned, how to practice will change)
- Effects of quantity on decision making
